# SwitchHub

**This is a work in progress.**

SwitchHub is a tool for remote management and control of home appliances (or really anything connected to an outlet). It's a DIY project based on the "internet of things" turned into an app.

Developed as a project for CSM117 at UCLA by Anthony Ortega, Gabriel Lopez, 
Omar Leyva, and Ryan Baker.
